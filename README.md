# EmptyRoom



**EmptyRoom** is a full-stack web application built to solve the **classroom and lab availability problem** at our university. It helps students and professors find and book free lecture halls in real-time, using a backend system that automatically extracts and syncs data from the official timetable Excel sheets.
